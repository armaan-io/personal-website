# Vision

I plan on creating this website as a personal portfolio but also to showcase my personality. What that means?..I'm not so sure. I am a person of various interests and I want to share some of them. 

For the longest time, I have wanted to start writing and to have my own blog or journal website. This is my chance. It will also be the host to any dev projects that I find are worthy of being shared (If I don't abandon them first).

So far I have only talked about what I want to do, and what I might want it to be, let me now try to turn that into a plan that I can follow and a guide I can refer to.

# The Plan

It is simple really. I only have one requirement, It shouldn't be boring.

Coming to the layout/structure, it needs to play host to My Projects, My Blog/Journal and...My Bio? (you can tell that I am well prepared and have totally thought this out.). 

Currently I have no ideas. But since moonshot is live rn and I am rewatching "Lost in Space", I think that having a spacey or futuristic theme could be fitting.
