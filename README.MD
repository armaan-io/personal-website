# Vision

I plan on creating this website as a personal portfolio but also to showcase my personality. What that means?..I'm not so sure. I am a person of various interests and I want to share some of them. 

For the longest time, I have wanted to start writing and to have my own blog or journal website. This is my chance. It will also be the host to any dev projects that I find are worthy of being shared (If I don't abandon them first).

So far I have only talked about what I want to do, and what I might want it to be, let me now try to turn that into a plan that I can follow and a guide I can refer to.

# The Plan

It is simple really. I only have one requirement, It shouldn't be boring.

Coming to the layout/structure, it needs to play host to My Projects, My Blog/Journal and...My Bio? (you can tell that I am well prepared and have totally thought this out.). 

~~Currently I have no ideas. But since moonshot is live rn and I am rewatching "Lost in Space", I think that having a spacey or futuristic theme could be fitting.~~

## Update (31/10/2025-01/11/2025):
I actually did something a bit different, then redid that things because it was buggy and didn't look that nice. It's still a WIP, but its actually halfway decent now. 

I spent a lot of time learning design and it was a pretty fun learning experience. Hopefully the desing will keep improving and evolving as I do.

## Update (03/11/2025):
It is now responsive, at least more than it was before, and can be viewed on mobile devices. I have also added Contact links and polished the css a little. 

thinking on adding some photo/sticker showreel in the future, also want to add some Hack Club elements (they are the reason I built this site!).
